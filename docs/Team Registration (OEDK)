Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown great promise in computer vision. However, their large draw back is the computational cost required to train a CNN. Using human intuition, we are able to efficiently parallelize existing CNNs with minimal changes to structure original structure, minimal user requirements, and minimal loss in performance. In addition, this principle could be applied to other common methods in machine learning in the future.
